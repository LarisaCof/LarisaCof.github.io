### Bachelor's Degree Project
My classmate Sara Moazez Gharebagh and I are going to
conduct a thesis project in the field of smart city parking management.
Through a comparative analysis of the mobile parking applications
EasyPark and LinPark, our goal is to investigate areas of development
regarding mobile parking applications and discuss the possibilities
for a nationally based parking application.

## Digital Twins Project
As part of the course ICT Innovation & Sustainable Development,
I worked on a group project assignment supervised by
IVL Swedish Environmental Institute.
The project goal was to investigate the applicability
and possible benefits of implementing the
digital twin technology in the Swedish water treatment sector.

## Memento
Group project as part of the course Information and Communication Technology.
The idea of Memento is to provide a fun learning service for
students of all ages. With Memento students can create and share flashcards,
quizzes, and study materials, such as notes and solution suggestions.
