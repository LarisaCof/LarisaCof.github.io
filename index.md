### Bachelor's Degree Project
My classmate Sara Moazez Gharebagh and I are going to

Through a comparative analysis of the mobile parking applications
EasyPark and LinPark, our goal is to investigate areas of development
regarding mobile parking applications and discuss the possibilities
for a nationally based parking application.
